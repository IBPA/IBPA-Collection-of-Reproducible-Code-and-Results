Description: # Meta-Omics: An Appilication for Omics Metadata Integration
        
        Life science experiment data are various and distributed among many databases. Therefore, providing clean and integrated metadata for biologists is important and useful. Meta-omics intends to integrate metadata retrieved from different databases and classify these metadata based on their omics types, minimizing human efforts in data collection.
        
        ## Installation
        
        First, clone the package to your machine:
        ```
        git clone git@github.com:fangzhouli/meta-omics.git
        ```
        Then go to the package directory to install:
        ```
        pip install meta-omics
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        After the installation, you can run the application in the command-line interface by using 'meta-omics' command followed by a string of a disease.
        ```
        meta-omics 'ischaemic heart disease'
        ```
        The amount of time depends on the disease, and after the application finishes running, it will generate a CSV file in the directory where you have executed the command.
        
        ## Format
        
        Each row of the output file is an experiment metadata. For each experiment, Meta-omics collects metadata listed below if available:
        
        - source        : Database the experiment retrieved from
        - accession     : Accession ID of experiment
        - title         : Title of the experiment
        - description   : Abstract of the experiment
        - pmid          : PMID of the publication associated with the experiment
        - pub_title     : Title of the publication
        - pub_date      : Date of the publication
        - pub_author    : Author(s) of the publication
        - tech_acc      : Accession ID of technologies used in the experiment
        - tech_name     : Name of technologies
        - sample_acc    : Accession ID for samples used in the experiment
        - species       : Species studied in the experiment
        - exp_type      : Experiment types provided by the source

        ## Future Work
        
        ### Database
        
        Currently, Meta-omics has only integrated GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) metadata. Meta-omics will continually integrate more databases, such as ArrayExpress, SRA (Sequence Read Archive), etc.
        
        ### Omics
        
        Meta-omics is dedicated to extract transcriptomics data, and we plan to add microbiomics data in the future.
        
        ### NLP (Natural Languange Processing)
        
        Meta-omics will utilize NLP techniques to achieve two novel features. First, Meta-omics will use NLP to curate patients metadata by mining experiment abstract and publication. Second, Meta-omics will practice NLP to filter the metadata retrieved from databases to provide cleaner metadata, furthering the minimization of human efforts.
        
        ### UI (User Interface)
        
        Currently, Meta-omics is designed as a command-line interface software. In the future, we will provide more user-friendly GUI.
